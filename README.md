This is a temptative draft for a textbook on R graphics and data
munging. Little progress has been made except TeX layout. The table of
contents does not actually reflect the final intent of this textbook. Git
timestamp for the PDF output has been deliberately kept at an older commit.

This document uses XeLaTeX and
[biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/), and a couple of shell and R
scripts to post-process figures. This may evolve with time, e.g. by using
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to crop figures (instead of `pdfcrop`).
