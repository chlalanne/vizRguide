This is a temptative draft for a textbook on R graphics and data
munging. Little progress has been made except regarding TeX layout. The
table of contents does not actually reflect the final intent of this
textbook. Git timestamp for the PDF output is sometimes kept at an older
commit.

This document uses XeLaTeX and
[biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/), and a couple of shell and R
scripts to post-process figures. This may evolve with time, e.g. by using
[knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) to crop figures (instead of `pdfcrop`),
`lualatex` instead of `xelatex` and, more genrally, a cleaner workflow. In
the meantime, here is what I am working on.
